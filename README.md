# Web-Scrapping-using-Python
# **Web Scraping**: 
Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites. 
Web scraping a web page involves fetching it and extracting from it. Fetching is the downloading of a page (which a browser does when a user views a page). Therefore, web crawling is a main component of web scraping, to fetch pages for later processing. 
Once fetched, then extraction can take place. The content of a page may be parsed, searched, reformatted, its data copied into a spreadsheet or loaded into a database. 
Web scrapers typically take something out of a page, to make use of it for another purpose somewhere else. An example would be to find and copy names and telephone numbers, or companies and their URLs, or e-mail addresses to a list (contact scraping).
Web Scraping is done using BeatifulSoup of bs4. This is my Web Scraping Project in Python. The project is done on the website of the Makaan.com and the Mumbai property filter is used in the website.
# bs4:
Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It works with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree. 
It commonly saves programmers hours or days of work.
